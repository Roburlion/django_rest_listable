Below is a step‐by‐step guide to creating a simple Django REST backend that responds with a “Hello, World!” message for a list app. This guide assumes you’re using Windows 11 with PowerShell and Python 3.11 is installed.

---

## 1. Set Up Your Environment

It’s recommended to work in a virtual environment so that your project dependencies don’t interfere with other projects.

### 1.1 Create a Virtual Environment

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder or create one
mkdir MyDjangoProject
cd MyDjangoProject

# Create a virtual environment named "env"
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

When activated, you should see the environment’s name (e.g., `(env)`) in your prompt.

### 1.2 Install Django and Django REST Framework

With your virtual environment active, install the necessary packages:

```powershell
pip install django djangorestframework
```

---

## 2. Create the Django Project and App

### 2.1 Start a New Django Project

Run the following command to create a new Django project called `myproject`:

```powershell
django-admin startproject myproject .
```

The dot (`.`) tells Django to create the project in the current folder.

### 2.2 Create the List App

Now, create an app called `listapp`:

```powershell
python manage.py startapp listapp
```

---

## 3. Configure the Project

### 3.1 Update `settings.py`

Open `myproject/settings.py` in your favorite editor and add both `rest_framework` and your app (`listapp`) to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Django default apps ...
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # Third-party apps
    'rest_framework',

    # Your apps
    'listapp',
]
```

### 3.2 (Optional) Configure REST Framework Settings

For this simple example, default settings are usually sufficient. In case you need to add custom settings later, you can add a `REST_FRAMEWORK` dictionary in your settings.

---

## 4. Create a “Hello, World!” API Endpoint

### 4.1 Define the View

Edit the file `listapp/views.py` to create an API view using the Django REST Framework decorator:

```python
# listapp/views.py

from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
def hello_world(request):
    return Response({"message": "Hello, World!"})
```

### 4.2 Set Up URL Routing for the App

Create a URL configuration file for your app by creating a new file named `listapp/urls.py` and add:

```python
# listapp/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import hello_world

urlpatterns = [
    path('', hello_world, name='hello_world'),
]
```

### 4.3 Include the App URLs in the Project

Edit your main project’s URL configuration in `myproject/urls.py` to include the `listapp` URLs:

```python
# myproject/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('listapp.urls')),  # All endpoints will be prefixed with /api/
]
```

---

## 5. Run and Test the Server

### 5.1 Apply Migrations

Even though we’re not adding models for this simple example, run migrations to set up the database:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5.2 Run the Development Server

Start your server with:

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
```

### 5.3 Test the API Endpoint

Open your web browser or use a tool like [curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```

You should see a JSON response:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

## 6. Summary and Next Steps

You’ve successfully built a simple Django REST backend for a list app with a “Hello, World!” endpoint. This basic setup can serve as a foundation for adding more complex models, views, and endpoints—for example, extending your app to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) list items.

### Next Steps You Might Consider

- **Model Creation:** Define models in `listapp/models.py` to represent list items.
- **Serializers:** Create serializers in a new file (e.g., `listapp/serializers.py`) to convert model instances into JSON.
- **CRUD Endpoints:** Expand your API to support full CRUD operations using Django REST Framework’s generic views or viewsets.
- **Testing:** Write tests to ensure your API works as expected.
- **Deployment:** Look into deploying your Django app using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
